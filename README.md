# Traverse

A game where you wander around in a procedurally generating world. I have no idea what you'll be able to do.

The plan is to implement a lot of relatively simple systems that will hopefully create interesting emergent behaviors. I suspect the game will end up something like a lame Dwarf Fortress clone, but who knows...
